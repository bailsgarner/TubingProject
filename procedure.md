**3.** **Go to Location**  

**4.** **Drop Off Group at Entry Point**  
Group members who have been dropped off should begin inflating tubes.  
  
**5.** **Take All Cars to Exit Point, Use One Car to Bring Back Drivers to Entry Point**  
The purpose of taking all cars to the exit point is to eliminate the need to walk back to cars at the end of the trip. One car will remain at the top, but they will be driven back to the entry point at the end of the trip.  
  
**6.** **Inflate Tubes**  
Tubes can be inflated by mouth or by pump. If there are a lot of tubes to be inflated, a pump is more efficient.

**7.** **Step Into the River, One Person at a Time With Your Inflated Tube**  
By entering the river one at a time, your group members can help prevent slipping as well as your tube floating away.  
  
**8.** **As each Additional Person Gets in the River, Tie the Tubes Together**  
Tying tubes together insures your group stayes together throughout the trip. Rope is recommended for a secure knot.

**9.** **Float Down the River**  
  
**10.** **Untie Tubes Once the Exit Point is Visible**  
In order to have a smooth transition from the river, untie your tubes as soon as the exit point is visible. However, for safety, continue to hold on to the tubes of your group members.  
  
**11.** **Get Out of the River**  
Help group members get out of the river by holding their tubes or giving a helping hand.  
  
**12.** **Deflate Tubes**  
For space purposes, it is better to deflate tubes on site. Unscrew the valve and gently squeeze the tube to let the air out.
