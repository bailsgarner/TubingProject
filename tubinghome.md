## **What is Tubing?**
River tubing is a popular summer pastime. Tubes are navigated and propelled by the current of a waterway. Tubers paddle with their hands and feet. Tubes can be outfitted with mesh seats, cup holders, and coolers. To insure a more relaxing group experience, some tubers choose to tie their tubes together so they navigate the river as one unit.

## **Why Go Tubing?**
Tubing is a low-cost fun family activity! Tubes can be reused time and time again as long as they are properly taken care of. Though many choose to tube through a professional company, it is not necessary. Choosing a park with a clear exit and entry point works just as well! Instead of spending your money at the water park, enjoy the free river flumes nature has to offer.
