### **Choosing a Tubing Location**  
**1.** **Choose a Location That Flows Through Public Property**  
In case of emergency, you need to be able to safely exit the river without trespassing. The best locations to float flow through public parks. Parks are often monitored and maintained.  
  
**2.** **Low Boat Traffic**  
Boats can ba a hazard while on the river. They create waves and a risk of being hit. Areas with low or no boat traffic are best for this reason.  
  
**3.** **Clear Entry and Exit Points**  
It is important to choose a location with clear entry and exit points for safety reasons. If you are unfamiliar with the location, an exit point with a flag or landmark can be beneficial to insure you do not miss your exit.  
  
**4.** **Clean Water**  
A location with clean water is important for the health of those going in your group. Research the water you will be floating in prior to choosing your location.
