## **Steps to Repair a Hole in a Tube**
**1.** **Dry the area**  
Tape will not stick to a wet tube.  
   
**2.**	**Cut 4 squares (minimum) of duck tape to cover hole**
The larger the hole, the more duct dape you will need. 

**3.** **Layer the tape on the tube so the hole is completely covered**
Multiple layers of duct tape will insure the bottom layer of tape remains dry throughout the trip.
  
**4.** **Inflate and test before getting in the water**
Insure you have repaired the leak prior to getting in the water. You do not want to sink halfway down the river.
