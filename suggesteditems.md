##Suggested Items to Bring Tubing
* **Sunscreen**  
The reflective properties of water increase your chances of getting a sunburn. Waterproof sunscreen of at least 15 SPF should help prevent severe sunburn.  

* **Outdoor or Water Shoes**  
Depending on your chosen tubing location, the entrance and exit points may be natural banks. To prevent slipping or falling, outdoor or water shoes are beneficial. Shoes that you do not mind getting wet are ideal so they can be worn in the river.  

* **Water and Snacks**  
Tubing trips can range from 2 to 4 hours depending on the length of your trip. Insuring you have water to keep hydrated and snacks is important.  

* **Styrofoam Cooler**  
Though not necessary, a styrofoam cooler is a great way to keep your drinks cold and refreshing. Styrofoam is recommended because they are low cost, float, and easily replaced if damaged.  
  
* **Tube for Styrofoam Cooler**  
If your cooler is heavy, a small tube for your cooler may be necessary.  
  
* **Waterproof Phone**  
Whether it's a case or the phone itself, a waterproof phone is important for safety reasons. Should an emergency occur, it's good to have phone access.  
  
* **Duck or Gorilla Tape**  
Nothing can ruin a trip like a flat tube. Duck or Gorilla tape can repare your tube while on the river. The following link shows a tutorial to repairing a tube.
